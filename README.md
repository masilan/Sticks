# Sticks
Sticks is a small puzzle game a couple friends of mine and I made at the May 2015 Codeday.
The preliminary version is console based, but we're planning to make an app version eventually.
The rules of the game are that on each player's turn, they can remove any number of sticks from a certain row.
The objective is to not remove the last stick. There are both single and multiplayer modes.
There is also an additional rule for the sake of political correctness where the computer can take sticks from different rows on the same turn because the computer does not have the privilege of an autonomous and independently thinking brain like any human player would have.
This rule helps balance the playing field between humans and computers and, hopefully, paves a path towards a society in the future where humans and machines are regarded as equals.
